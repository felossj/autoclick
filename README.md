## real ac bypasses
- vulcan 12-16 cps ([video](https://youtu.be/UeklgYz6cAI))
- verus 14-18 cps
- hypixel 20-22 cps
- astralmc 13-18 cps

## bypass guide
- download the file in %temp% folder and name it something like "+~JF3888639446943723253.tmp" (dont download and then change name because it will appear on journaltrace)
- launch clicker with rundll32
- self destruct
- press win+r, types prefetch and press enter
- deletes all files with rundll32 name on them
- press win+r, types regedit and press enter
- go to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\ and open the folder with the longest name
- right click this folder and give administrators full permisions, deletes the file called C:\Windows\System32\rundll32, uncheck the full permisions for administrators and minimize all folders
- this lil guide probably make you bypass manual screenshares but this clickers isnt screenshare proof and most ss tools probably detects it
